# Thankful

[![Build](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/actions/workflows/build.yml)

_Support free culture by automatically sending cryptocurrency to the creators of the content you love._

Thankful is an app that keeps track of the websites you visit, the videos you watch, the music you listen to (not yet), which applications you use (such as Thankful itself) and then tries to figure out who created it so that you can choose to easily support those you find deserving, by directly sending them cryptocurrency.

This helps solve a fundamental issue on the internet where ad-funded creators have incentive to steal your attention as long as possible instead of providing you with as much value as they can. By using Thankful, you incentivize creators to spend more time and effort on creating **what you want**, and reward those who do.

Thankful is being developed by [Superuser Labs](https://superuserlabs.github.io/). We hope that people will want to express their gratitude towards others so we can have healthier incentives on the internet.

## What content can currently be funded by Thankful?

We want to make it easy to support creators on all platforms and mediums. These are the things we're currently supporting:

- **Videos**: on YouTube
- **Code**: on GitHub
- **Writing**: on Medium

We want to support more types of content on more platforms, see [this page in our wiki](https://github.com/SuperuserLabs/thankful/wiki/Content-to-support-in-the-future) for our ideas.
